# Research methods (first part)

**Question 1**

In the required readings of this week we called to process of clarifying abstract concepts and translating them into specific, observable measures **operationalization**. This involves both a **nominal** and an **operational** definition. Describe in your own words what these terms mean. 

Answer here.

**Question 2**

Two different definitions of **emotional well-being** are provided by the Mental Health Foundation. For each of the following definitions, decide whether it constitutes a nominal or an operational definition:
    a. "A positive sense of well-being which enables an individual to be able to function in society and meet the demands of everyday life."
    b. "People in good mental health have the ability to recover effectively from illness, change or misfortune."

Answer here.

**Question 3**

Two different definitions of **financial literacy** can be found in literature. For each of the following definitions, decide whether it constitutes a nominal or an operational definition:
    a. "The ability to read, analyze, manage and communicate about the personal financial conditions that affect material well-being."
    b. "The ability to manage effectively personal savings, credits and borrowed money as well as personal investments."

Answer here.

**Question 4**

Suppose you want to study financial literacy, given the numerous benefits it brings to society, and given the documented lack of financial education. Would you use the following operational definition of financial literacy: “The ability to correctly predict short term fluctuations in the stock market?"

Answer here.

**Question 5**

The graph below is a visual representation of the concepts of validity and reliability.

```{r validreliab, fig.cap="A visual representation of the concepts validity and reliability. Imagine the theoretical construct you want to measure is the bullseye of the dartboard and the dots represent an attempt at measurement. Illustration adapted from an illustration by Nevit Dilmen, Wikimedia Commons.", echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,dev='png'}
knitr::include_graphics('data/ValidReliab.png')
```

For each one of the three statements below, indicate whether it corresponds to dart board A, B, C or none.

* The measure of our concept is valid, but not reliable.
* The measure of our concept is reliable, but not valid.
* The measure of our concept is neither valid, not reliable.
* The measure of our concept is both valid and reliable.

Answer here.

**Question 6**

The National Health Care Institute of the Netherlands partners with local schools to provide a weekly physical exercise program for children ages 6-14. The sessions are designed to last throughout the whole academic year, and they will take place in afternoon hours. They also consist of both a theoretical and a practical part. In the theoretical part, volunteers strive to increase children’s exercise habits by teaching them about the benefits of regular exercise, whereas in the practical part, they organize various age-appropriate sports activities for children to participate in. Changes in exercise habits are measured via a questionnaire at the end of the program. However, the program manager is concerned that the questionnaire is not producing high-quality observations, particularly for questions that ask children about their exercise habits before participating in the program. Assuming the problem is with measurement and not with the program design…

* What is the most likely measurement problem? Reliability or validity?
* What type of error is most likely producing this problem? Constant error, random error and/or correlated error? 
* How might the program address this measurement problem?
    
Answer here.

**Question 7 **

The Dutch Environmental Assessment Agency aims to identify sections of Dutch rivers for stream bank restoration. The goal of this work is to create stream bank conditions that can lead to eventual water quality improvements. Crews of national service volunteers implement remediation in accordance with the waterway management plan, including removal of trash and debris from stream banks, removal of invasive plants, reintroduction of native plants, and erosion abatement. Land managers from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management inspect project sites within two weeks of project completion. The assessment instrument used by land managers contains checkbox items to indicate whether various remediation actions were taken but does not provide a way to assess the quality of these remediation actions with respect to environmental standards. This problem should be of high concern to the land managers, given the fact that high quality environmental standards are hard to meet, even when all the appropriate actions have been taken. Assuming the problem is with measurement and not with the program design…

* What is the most likely measurement problem? Reliability or validity?
* What type of error is most likely producing this problem? Constant error, random error and/or correlated error? 
* How might the program address this measurement problem?

# Lab manual examples R (second part)

You can keep notes about the R part of the tutorial here and copy and paste R code in the code block below.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

# Copy and paste the R code of the examples from the tutorial manual here.

```

# Generalization exercises R (second part)


```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

# Use the code from the tutorial manual examples to attempt to solve this assignment

#1. Make a graph plotting Life Expectancy by year for the five continents, using the `continent` factor. Make sure you change the title as well.

#2. Make a graph plotting GDP per capita by year for the USA, Canada, and Mexico. Use the `gdpPercap` column for the GDP per capita data.

#3. Make a new graph plotting anything you are interested in using the gapminder dataset. It just needs to be a plot that we have not given an example for.

```

# Writing assignment R (second part)

Describe what histograms are, how to interpret them, and what they are useful for. You should answer each of these questions:

a. What do the bars on a histogram represent?
b. How many bars can a histogram have?
c. What do the heights of the bars tell you?
d. What is on the x-axis and y-axis of a histogram?
e. What does the tallest bar on a histogram tell you?
f. What does the shortest bar on a histogram tell you?
g. What are some uses for histograms, why would you want to look at a histogram of some numbers that you collected?
h. Imagine you had two histograms, one was very wide and spread out, the other was very narrow with a very tall peak. Which histogram would you expect to contain more consistent numbers (numbers that are close to each other) and explain why.
