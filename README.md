## Important notes {-}
This is the lab manual for Quantitative Research Methods & Analysis at EUC. As with the textbook, this manual was adapted from "Answering questions with data" by Mattew J.C. Crump. 

The original text is part of a [larger OER (Open Educational Resource) course](https://osf.io/3s68c/) for teaching undergraduate statistics in psychology. As such, the text assumes you are a psychology student and many of the examples are drawn from the field of psychology. This does not mean that this course is only useful for you if you have an interest in psychology. The field of psychology will serve as a vehicle to teach you important concepts and skills in quantitative research methods and data analysis, but the concepts and skills taught are universal. 

This manual provides the exercises we will work on during labs. We use open-data sets that are usually paired with a primary research article. The manual is a free and open resource. See below for more information about copying, making change, or contributing to the lab manual.
